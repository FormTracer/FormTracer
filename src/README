(**************************************************)

(******) Part 1: Install FormTracer Package (******)

Option 1: Automatic Installation (recommended)
	Open a Mathematica notebook and evaluate
	Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FormTracer/FormTracer/master/files/FormTracerInstaller.m"]

	What it does: The installer downloads the compressed folder FormTracer.zip from Github and extracts it
	into Mathematica's Applications folder in the user directory. The installer then loads the FormTracer
	package. If FORM is not found on your computer, you are asked whether you want to install FORM. If
	you choose to do so, the binary for your operating system is downloaded from http://www.nikhef.nl/~form/
	and copied into the FormTracer directory in the Applications folder where the FormTracer finds it.

Option 2: Manual Installation
	Open https://github.com/FormTracer/FormTracer in a browser and download FormTracer.zip.
	Alternatively you may download the zip file directly from 
	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FormTracer/FormTracer/master/FormTracer.zip
	Then extract FormTracer.zip into Mathematica's applications folder.


(******) Part 2: Install FORM (********************)

This step is not necessary if FORM is already installed on your system or you chose to install FORM automatically during part 1.

To install FORM, you can obtain it from
1.) http://www.nikhef.nl/~form/ (recommended)
or
2.) https://github.com/vermaseren/form (in this case, follow the instructions provided at github).

If you download the binary from http://www.nikhef.nl/~form/, copy it either into one of your paths
for binaries (e.g. /opt/bin/ or /usr/bin/) or into the FormTracer folder, which you find at 
~/.Mathematica/Applications/FormTracer (for Unix systems).

By default, the FormTracer tries to call FORM with the following commands:
~/.Mathematica/Applications/FormTracer/form
form
/usr/bin/form
/opt/bin/form
~/.Mathematica/Applications/FormLink/bin/<operating system>/form
If the FORM binary lies in any of the paths above, the FormTracer will find it.
If you have installed FORM somewhere else or you want to use a different FORM version
temporarily, you can use DefineFormExecutable[path to executable] to set a different path.


(**************************************************)
(***** 2.: Usage Instructions *********************)
(**************************************************)

To get started, type FormTracer into a Mathematica input cell and press F1.
Then Mathematica searches for FormTracer in the Documentation Center. You'll be led
to the FormTrace help page which provides detailed usage instructions.

Alternatively, you may also open the examples
	FormTracerMinimalExample.nb or
	FormTracerShowCase
Both can be found in the Examples folder in the FormTracer directory which lies
in Mathematica's Applications folder.
