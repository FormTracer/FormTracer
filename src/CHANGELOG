(************* FormTracer Changelog ***************)
(**************************************************)


(***********) FormTracer Version 1.9.6 (***********)
- Removed unnecessary summation over diagrams (D=+D1;) in case of just one diagram (increases performance).


(***********) FormTracer Version 1.9.5 (***********)
- Bugfix for installer under MacOS in combination with Mathematica 10.
- Some minor updates to documentation


(***********) FormTracer Version 1.9.4 (***********)
- Minor improvements to update functions.
- Commented out Cygwin[] because it's not used (but might be in the future).


(***********) FormTracer Version 1.9.3 (***********)
- Simple download of cygwin1.ddl from http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~cyrol/downloads/cygwin1.dll
- Bugfix in InstallCygwin[].


(***********) FormTracer Version 1.9.2 (***********)
- Added - sign after #include of group algorithms to avoid them being re-printed.
- Support for Windows systems in installer.
- InstallCygwin[] introduced for Windows systems.


(***********) FormTracer Version 1.9.1 (***********)
- Bugfix in ShowFormTracerChangeLog (if online version not found, i.e. local version was to be shown).
- Fixed declaration issue with SU3fundexplicit in case no color group was defined.
- Fixed Mathematica replacements for sqrt_ and pow.


(***********) FormTracer Version 1.9.0 (***********)
- Solved DisableDynamicUpdating issue by using RunProcess (instead of Import["!form..."]) to call FORM. This way the shell is circumvented and everything works smoothly. The FormTracer might even be faster now.
- FormTracer version number is now read off form PacletInfo.m (no duplicate storage any longer)
- Resolution of finite T numerical factors in momenta now only takes place if T>0 and combined Lorentz tensors are present, otherwise it is not necessary.
- Warning note for Windows users.
- Incombatibility warning for Mathematica version < 10 users.
- Bugfix: DefineExtraVars[] did not clear extra variables (but DefineExtraVars[{}] did).


(***********) FormTracer Version 1.8.5 (***********)
- Proper documentation of the FormTracer in Mathematica's Documentation Center.
- Removed C specific export code from "flow" file if output format is not C.
- Bugfix: removed _String from filename argument in FormTrace to allow passing of lists for more detailed export options.


(***********) FormTracer Version 1.8.1 (***********)
- Bugfix: formTracerDirectory was not set correctly if the FormTracer was installed in the system-wide applications directory.
- Removed outdated argument genuineLorIndices from convertPartiallyTracedOutput.
- Minor changes to documentation in FormTracer.nb.


(***********) FormTracer Version 1.8.0 (***********)
- First version that has the full functionality for first publication with no known bugs.
- Documentation not yet integrated into Mathematica's Documentation Center.
